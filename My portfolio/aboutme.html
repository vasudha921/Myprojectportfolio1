  <p>
      I am Vasudha Bhat, I am 12 years old.
      I love reading and writing poems. 
      I joined Whitehatjr, a platform for coding, and I love it. 
      It is amazing and I hope you join it too. 
      I wrote a lot of poems like, "The Ocean", "Animals", etc. 
      I also like to travel and I want to become an engineer in the future. 
      I have a little sister named Medha. She is 7 years old and she is so funny and crazy. 
      She likes cartoons like "My Little Pony", "Sofia the First" and a lot more...... 
      She also likes to draw. She wants to become an engineer and a rockstar. She is so cray cray.
